# Latex class for notes
Designed to make creating sets of notes for new projects quick and painless.

## Installation
### MacOS
Include a copy of `notes.cls` in the directory containing your `.tex` source files (e.g. `main.tex`).

If you don't want to worry about making a new `notes.cls` copy for each new document, you can do the following:
- Move the `notes.cls` file to the directory `/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/`. 
- Run `texhash` or `sudo texhash`
You should now be able to use the document class system-wide.

## Usage
See the included `example.tex` file and associated `example.pdf`.
